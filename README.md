Lab 1: Caesar cipher template

This is a template for assignment 1. In this assignment, you are asked to implement the Caesar cipher and break it. To do so, follow the steps below.

## Steps

1. You should implement Caesar Cipher [here](./CaesarCipher/caesar_cipher.py)
2. Use the implemented Caesar cipher to encrypt and decrypt inputs [here](./CaesarCipher/01_caesar_cipher.py)
3. Try to break the implemented Caesar cipher by brute force attack [here](./CaesarCipher/02_breaking_caesar.py)
4. Try to implement and test a double Caesar cipher [here](./CaesarCipher/03_double_caesar_cipher.py)
